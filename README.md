# pupil
Code and instructions for pre-processing and statistical analysis of evoked pupillary responses used in the research paper **Pupillary dynamics reflect age-related changes in memory encoding**. 

All the code was written on **Matlab**. A graphical interface based on Matlab's AppDesigner is available for those who don't want to go into the code but would like to reproduce the analyses.

The aim of the EyeCog study (CNRS, ID-RCB 2021-A02686-35) was to investigate the link between pupillary marker and cognitive performance, and the evolution of this relationship in non-pathological aging. Pupil data were obtained from the **EyeBrain T2 eyetracker** from Suricog (Paris, France).
